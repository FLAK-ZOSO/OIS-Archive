## 🚀 Introduction
>
> This repository aims to collect as much material as possible relating to problems in the Olinfo platform, storing 100 out of 100 solutions for as many problems as possible..
> 

**Among the most relevant features:**

1. 100 out of 100 correct solutions. ✅
2. Clean and commented C++ code. 💫
3. Computational cost analysis (Big O notation). 🐌
4. Organisation of challenges by topic. 📚
5. Explanation of the algorithm used for each problem. 🔥

## 📦 Archive
The repository is structured as follows:
```
Ois-Archive
├── Archive
│   ├── ...
│   ├── problem_folder
│   │   ├── problem_name.cpp
│   │   ├── statement.pdf
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── INDEX.md
├── ...
└── README.md
```
So all problem solutions are placed in the `Archive` folder, in which you will find both an `INDEX.md` file, containing links for easy navigation through the archive, and a subfolder for each problem for which you have archived a solution.

In this second folder you will find the commented cpp file, the `statement.pdf` file, with the text and the requirements of the problem, and if necessary also a `README.md` file which explains how the algorithm works.

## 💥 Contribute
If you intend to contribute to this collection, feel free to open a pull request, and once your code is validated and conforms to the repository standards it will be integrated with the whole repository.
